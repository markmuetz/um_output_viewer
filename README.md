um_output_viewer
================

umov is a tool for viewing UM output.
umov is designed with the following top level goals:

* Repeatability: any output can be reproduced easily
* Configurability: easy to config with sensible options
* Caching: initial analysis is cached for faster experimentation with figs
* Organised: output is sensibly organised/archived
